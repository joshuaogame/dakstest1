The first of the two Los Angeles teams have unveiled their branding! Under the Immortals organization, the Los Angeles Valiant is ready, sporting a green and gold color scheme. The gold winged helmet is their logo, mirroring the helmet logo of the Immortals organization while representing both aggressiveness and protectiveness. Immortals Chairman Clinton Foy solidifies this stance, noting a “synergy between” the Immortals and Valiant brands. Immortals CEO Noah Whinston also had much to say about the team. He stated that the Valiant were about:
> “Signifying heroism and demonstrating courage, bravery, and determination — that’s who we are and who we will always strive to be.”

While the synergy for the Immortals and Valiant logos are apparent, this was not a conscious decision on the part of the Immortals organization. In an interview with Forbes, Noah Whinston admits this, stating:
> “So we do really like the link [to the Immortals logo] but honestly the logo wasn’t done fully internally, that’s a process done in partnership with Activision Blizzard, and the helm being the symbol of the Los Angeles Valiant, it came from Blizzard. So we’re happy with the tie-in to the old Immortals branding, but we also think that that branding stands alone really well.”

He also notes the level of involvement not only on Blizzard’s part but that the teams are working together to make the Overwatch League a success. The franchises do speak and reveal plans to each other, with him highlighting:

> “There’s a cooperative and collaborative effort because we understand that we’re all stakeholders in the same broader project. No team can succeed if the league fails and the league can’t succeed if teams fail. So in this type of system, we all have mutual incentives to make sure that everyone succeeds. I don’t want to be the best team in a bad league.”


The Los Angeles Valiant will reap the benefits of their parent organization and the investors tied to it. Through AEG Worldwide, they will be able to play and organize events at the L.A. Live complex. Also, the Immortals headquarters and campus in Culver City will be at their disposal as well. This campus will shift away from the gaming house standard, with Whinston explaining:

>We really want to be empowering our players to live healthy lives, not just inside of the game, and not just during work hours, but at all points in their lives. To do that you need to give players some modicum of control over their own environment and their home life.

While there has been no confirmation of a roster yet, there have been rumors of a lineup of 10 players. With a quarter of the Overwatch League’s teams revealed, it’s shaping up to be an exciting show for both fans and players alike.
