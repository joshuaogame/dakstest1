The official launch of the Task Us Titans has come! Introduced at High Grounds Cafe, the team undertook a meet and greet session for players and fans alike. With a team coached by Mark ”Cast” Pilar, its team members are:

Support- Abeng “Abeng” Dicdican
Support- Don Carlo “BDZ” Manalo
Offlane- Ryo “ryOyr” Hasegawa
Midlane- Karl Matthew “Santino” Jaime
Carry- Froilan “Sip” Bonifacio

Within a Q&A session, the Titans note that they have prepared through rigorous training with individual practice on their core heroes. Also, the team has built chemistry through a positive environment with bonding and daily practice. The team believes that they are ready for the tough competition that awaits them. Coach Cast also wished the team good ventures in their participation in tournaments and hopes the members reach their aspirations with the TaskUs Titans.

Beyond the meet and greet, the TaskUs Titans also participated in a show match against a team from the audience. They picked a lineup of Night Stalker, Monkey King, Puck, Enchantress and Shadow Shaman, and showed a mastery of the game. With the Titans on the Dire side, their intense pressure with their rotations allowed them to push the enemy team’s towers. By the 20th minute mark, the Radiant team was stuck in their base, and the Titans forced them to call for the GG a few minutes later. With a score of 6–25, the Titans won in impressive fashion.

The TaskUs Titans are positioning themselves to be a team worthy of contention for the crown of the top Dota 2 team in the country. With the likes of TNC, Mineski, Execration, and much more within the scene, they have a tough task ahead of them. RyOyr is confident, however, ending the Q&A by saying: “Abangan yung mga games, at i-support ang TaskUs.” (“Wait on the games, and support TaskUs.”) With the confidence and talent the TaskUs Titans boast, they will be a team worthy to watch.
