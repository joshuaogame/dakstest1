Within AsiaPOP Comicon 2017, Predator Philippines hosted a tournament to showcase Overwatch players in 1v1 Limited Duel action. Spanning three days, 32 participants signed up for the event. On the first and second day (August 25 & 26), there were 16 players battling each other in a single elimination format. On each day, four rose up from the rest and moved on to the finals, which happened on August 27. Eight contestants clashed on the last day, with Daniel “FenHarel” Laguerta of Rekt Esports bringing home the grand prize- an Acer Predator 15 laptop.


Recapping the preliminaries, the first day had notable names within the brackets. Caladbolg, the former team captain of Mineski-Overwatch, came out of retirement to take part in the tournament. Whome, the current captain of Mineski, also participated, and the expectation was that the two would clash in the finals for the day. Both fell in the second round, in down to the wire situations in their best of 3’s. Their opponents, Metannica and MajinDayo, dubbed as the “Mineski-Slayers”, snatched the slots in the top four. Alongside them were Fatal Faction’s (formerly Sapnu Puas) DodgeThiss and Feint. The two Fatal Faction players moved on to face each other in the finals, with DodgeThiss securing a sweep against Feint with a score of 3–0.

Day 2 of the 1v1 Heroes Uprising Tournament (August 26).
The second day proved to have even more high-caliber players and games. Grand, Xenos, and Fascinate, all players of Miraculum, participated. Fascinate and Grand (who beat Xenos in a close match) moved on to the final four, with Yoyong and FenHarel of Rekt Esports joining them. Grand and Fascinate then beat their respective opponents and had a great match-up in the finals. Grand took the early lead, taking the first two maps with authority. Fascinate then bounced back, taking key match-ups, and completed the reverse sweep to take the series 3–2. While for both days the final four moved on as soon as they reached the semifinals, Predator Philippines provided prizes for the first, second and third places of each day.


The final day had the eight finalists salivating at the thought of bringing home the Predator 15 laptop. FenHarel, in a complete 180 after a night to reset himself, put on a clinical display against Fascinate. FenHarel then faced off against and defeated Metannica. Prior to fighting FenHarel, Metannica died to the only ultimate of the tournament, the Tactical Visor used by Yoyong in their first round match. On the other side of the bracket, Feint defeated MajinDayo while DodgeThiss beat Grand in a tight match. In a rematch of the first-day finals, Feint relied on exceptional Soldier:76 play to beat DodgeThiss to move on to the finals to face FenHarel.


The Grand Finals of the 1v1 tournament was a contested match-up. Feint relied on his comfort DPS picks against FenHarel, overpowering him with a strong offense. FenHarel bounced back with key victories in Tracer mirror matchups. FenHarel also provided better flexibility, taking rounds from Feint with strong showings using Tank and Support picks. FenHarel and Feint put each other to the limit, forcing the 5th map after a 2–2 score. FenHarel took the series in an Orisa vs. Junkrat matchup on the final match point, bringing home the Predator 15 laptop.


After his victory, I was able to conduct a short interview FenHarel. He thanked the support of his friends, especially those who were there for him the night before the grand finals. As he was looking around for specific people, a good part of the crowd chanted “Good job!” at him, to his delight. When asked about what characters he relied on, he noted his Soldier:76 play delivering for him, and that he got a hot streak on Tracer. He was unsure about the Tracer match-up at first, but he grew more confident as he kept winning the mirror match-up. He also commended Feint on his strength, noting his participation in the upcoming SEA Open Division and his rank of Masters. This did not deter him in any way though, as his mindset throughout the whole tournament was that “this was a 1v1”, and as such, it was possible to push himself to win. And that he did.
