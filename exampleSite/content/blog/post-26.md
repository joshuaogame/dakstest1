This past ESGS 2017, Predator Gaming hosted a series of challenges to highlight their booth. PUBG, DOTA 2, and Overwatch were all showcased and played to show the power of the Predator machines. Overwatch was a popular attraction due to its Duo Junkenstein Challenge. The base game mode, Junkenstein’s Revenge, is a 4 player PvE mode where the objective is to defend the gate. Pitting players against hordes of mobs and boss characters, a scoring system is installed to allow a leaderboard for the mode. For the challenge, small modifications were done to Junkenstein’s Revenge. These were unlocking the full hero roster and reducing the team size from 4 to 2.


Over 3 days, many teams of 2 came to the Predator Gaming booth to participate in the challenge. On Day 1, teams struggled due to the smaller team size, and no team finished the map. The highest score reached only 3964 points with a Zenyatta-Bastion lineup. The second day was a different story, with teams finally finishing the map, breaching the 7000 point marker. Team XJZ topped the charts of Day 2, with a score of 7,992 and establishing a meta- the lineup of Torbjorn and Zenyatta.

The Torbjorn-Zenyatta combination became the staple pick of the challenge.
Day 3 brought in scores beyond prediction. With all the top teams using the Torbjorn-Zenyatta combination, one stood out with a score of 10,669. The Meme Team exceeded all expectations with a 5-digit score. Talking with the Meme Team, they noticed that most of the other teams leave the gate alone during the final wave. Upon completion, bonuses are awarded for surviving, killing bosses quickly, and door health. With that in mind, they constantly re-created the turret of Torbjorn if it went down.


The top 3 teams of each day, for each game, went home with Predator Gaming Backpacks per player. The Duo Junkenstein Challenge brought in both newbies and veterans alike. Thanks to the hosting of Predator Gaming and the on-site work by Overrush, the popularity of Overwatch was highlighted at ESGS 2017.
