The Overwatch League Stage 2 is underway, and what better way to get hyped than to rank the teams! With heavy performances from Stage 1, a number of roster moves, and a new Mercy-less meta the landscape of the Overwatch League is set to be changed once again. Coming into the next stage, these factors have caused expectations of teams to perform either better or worse. I’ve taken these into account and ranked my personal list, with records in a “series then maps” format below:
1st — New York Excelsior

Record: 9–1 ( 31–10–2, +21)
Roster Changes: None
The New York Excelsior sits on top of the League at 9–1, and only have 2 smudges on their record- the 1 loss to the Philadelphia Fusion and being downed by the London Spitfire in the Series 1 Finals. Both these match-ups were down to the wire, and they have proven that they are the top team in the Overwatch League. Their consistent and methodological plays have dismantled opponents. Their players are living highlight reels, especially Pine and JJoNak. The regular season looks like a smooth road for the NYXL to improve their impressive record on. Concerns for the team still loom on the horizon, due to their historical underperformance during key games- the playoffs.
2nd — London Spitfire

Record: 7–3 (29–14–0, +15)
Roster Changes:
(-) Rascal
(-) Fissure
The Series 1 Champions have finally lost 2 members of their 12-man roster. Both Rascal and Fissure felt underutilized and wished for playing time, which the Spitfire couldn’t provide. Regardless, the strong core is still there for the squad, and their performance in the Stage 1 Finals cemented their strength. The former two teams have meshed together into 1 cohesive unit, and if they could channel their level of play from the Stage Finals into Stage 2, they have the best chance of dethroning New York. For practice, however, they may have to find 2 more extra players for their in-team scrims…
3rd — Houston Outlaws

Record: 7–3 (30–13–0, +17)
Roster Changes:
(+) FCTFCTN
My most impressive team of the Overwatch League Stage 1, the Houston Outlaws not only went above and beyond expectations but also positioned themselves as the top Western team. Their roster, lacking any Korean players, has been a fusion of two cultures. The Western playstyle of the team has been bolstered by their coach Tairong’s Korean tactics. This will come into play heavily as the Mercy meta is gone, and the chaos of the tempo resurrects will no longer plague the Korean teams. While the JAKErat may be less potent, Houston could still be 1 of the few teams that can keep up with the expected Korean skill gap for Stage 2. The addition of the American Tank player FCTFCTN will also give the Blizzard Arena home crowd a “Team USA” to cheer and chant for.
4th — Seoul Dynasty

Record: 7–3 (25–16–2, +9)
Roster Changes: None
The Seoul Dynasty once sat on top of lists like this, but have fallen as they lost maps to lesser teams and failed to reach the Stage 1 playoffs. Miro’s underperformance, both tobi and ryujehong being forced onto the Mercy, and the focus on enemies onto Fleta solved the “how to beat Seoul” conundrum. Now, with the meta shift, the Seoul Dynasty should be poised to shine once again with the world’s best Lucio and Ana players. They stand to gain the most in the newest meta and are thus thrust into a higher power ranking over teams with better map records. Hopefully, an amazing Sleep Dart — Boop combination will be in store for the next Seoul Dynasty highlights.
5th — Los Angeles Valiant

Record: 7–3 (26–13–3, +13)
Roster Changes: None
The Valiant have had ups and downs throughout Stage 1, with their greatest asset being that they play well in clutch situations, spearheaded by SoOn. However, the nature of being in clutch situations was also their map score downfall, as their inconsistency throughout the duration of matches puts them always at risk. This cost them a slot in the Stage 1 playoffs as they had no choice but to wait for the other teams to finalize their records. Their level of play is still high, however, and they are seen as a team that can contend with the Korean teams of New York, London, and Seoul. Also, they have handily won the battle for Los Angeles so far.
6th — Boston Uprising

Record: 6–4 (27–17–0, +10)
Roster Changes: None
The belle of the ball for the Overwatch League, the former “unknowns” have proven to be in the top echelon of play. First impressing fellow Overwatch League teams in scrims, they have shone on the main stage to the Overwatch community. With players like DreamKazper and Striker given a stage to shine, the Boston Uprising played like real contenders. Narrowly missing the Stage 1 playoffs after losing an extremely close match against the Outlaws, Boston is hungry to improve and the team looks like they are aiming for total victory in the League to prove to the world that they are names to be remembered. No one expected this team to be in proper contention, and I for one am glad to have new names be popularized in the Overwatch community.
7th — Philadelphia Fusion

Record: 6–4 (20–24–1, -4)
Roster Changes: None
The lower half of the Overwatch League power rankings begin with the most middle-of-the-road team: the Fusion. Beyond the heroics of Carpe and Shadowburn, the team performs averagely, usually beating teams they are supposed to beat and losing to teams that they are supposed to lose to. Half of their series end up with a tiebreaker, lowering their total map score. The team’s game performance was also a rollercoaster due to the Mercy meta. The team is mechanically skilled, but their team tactics and decision making are head scratchers. In the long run, these may prove to be the team’s downfall. The team needs to fuse as a cohesive unit, or risk having to become the league’s standard of a “middle ground”.’
8th- Los Angeles Gladiators

Record: 4–6 (16–26–0, -10)
Roster Changes:
(+) Fissure
The other team of Los Angeles, the Gladiators have underperformed throughout Stage 1. Their lineup looks like they can be better and the team has have had flashes of greatness, but have been felled by most of their competition. The Tank synergy was the glaring issue of the team, and the addition of Fissure from London Spitfire will seek to alleviate this issue. With a greater frontline, the pressure will be off the DPS players (Surefour, Asher, Hydration) and give the Gladiators a better fighting chance. Shields will be up, courtesy of Fissure and the rest of LAG.
9th — Dallas Fuel

Record: 3–7 (14–25–3, -11)
Roster Changes:
(+) aKm
(+) Rascal
Most people see the additions of aKm, Rascal, and the return of xQc will be the answer that Dallas has been waiting for. However, I am skeptical of these additions. The two new additions to the Fuel are both DPS players, and the roster now has 5 (arguably 6 with HarryHook) players vying for playing time. Tank play will have more diversity with xQc’s hero pool, but for a team that expectations are some of the highest, it might not be enough. The team should be great and should be near the top of the standings, but their reality is different. Dallas needs to do extremely well in Stage 2 to stabilize their record and have a chance for the Season championship. Here’s hoping that they don’t burn out along the way.
10th — San Francisco Shock

Record: 3–7 (16–24–2, -8)
Roster Changes: None
Literally who? The Shock barely has a presence in the Overwatch League, and their team play shows it. The team can barely function as a unit, with their games just being a blip on the schedules of the other teams. The organization has also not done any moves and is banking on its young players’ eligibility to magically improve the team. While the skills of Sinatraa and Super are some of the highest in the DPS and Tank roles respectively, the Shock’s lack of movements makes it seem like they are expecting the 2 players to be the magical band-aid they need. With an attitude like that from both the team and the organization, it’s not shocking for everyone to think that the Shock’s season starts in March.
11th- Florida Mayhem

Record: 1–9 ( 9–31–1, -22)
Roster Changes:
(+) Sayaplayer
(+) aWesomeGuy
It’s been mayhem for the boys in Mcdonalds’ colors, with only 1 victory under their belt against the lowly Shanghai Dragons. The addition of the Meta Athena players may be the talent the Florida organization desperately needs and is a good sign that management is finally willing to spend money. The meta shift will also do great for the team as Zebbosai’s absolute hatred of playing Mercy can finally be quelled. The Florida Mayhem still has a lot of work to do, but both the game and the management have adjusted so it’s up to the players to take some orders and delivers some victories.
12th- Shanghai Dragons

Record: 0–10 ( 6–36–0, -30)
Roster Changes: (+) Sky
(+) Geguri
(+) Fearless
(+) Ado
No team should not have any series victories in the highest stage of Overwatch play. Shanghai Dragons have managed to do so, and Stage 1 was the lowest point of the team. The Chinese squad went below already low expectations, with games looking like solo queue competitive play rather than a pro league. While near the tail end they were seen to be improving, it was still not enough for any victories. Now, 4 players have been added including the first female OWL player in Geguri. However, 3/4 of these players are Korean and the language barrier seems to be the greatest hindrance in an otherwise full Chinese team. Stage 2 will still be a learning process and a “room for improvement” situation for the squad. Expect the Dragons to be at the bottom of the league for a while longer. China number none, in victories that is.
