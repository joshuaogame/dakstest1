Co-developed by Garena and Tencent Games, the game draws an estimate of 100 Million players daily. Also known as Honor of Kings in China, Arena of Valor seeks to establish a foothold in the American, European markets alongside the rest of the Asia. Set to release this month for Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines, Garena will handle its publication and distribution.

Arena of Valor promotes that 14 heroes can be unlocked permanently for free among the wide hero roster. This is explained by Garena to be through the tutorial, the Road of Glory quest line, and playing with friends. The game also highlights a 3-lane 5v5 MOBA experience. Beyond the standard map, there also other maps built for 3v3 and 1v1 action, and Garena has other unique game modes in their plans. There will also be a credibility system to punish AFK and toxic players while rewarding players for good conduct.

Arena of Valor already has an established esports scene, with an estimate of a total of Php362 Million prize pool given out throughout the globe. The Throne of Glory Invitational Tournament highlights this, with a $65,000 prize pool and a peak viewership of 273,626 viewers. The game also promotes local competitions, with grassroots competitions planned for the country and an established professional league. With a ranked system set in place, top-tier players can easily be found and thrust into the game’s esports leagues.

Looking at the roots of the game, the game seems to draw inspiration from League of Legends. With Riot Games owned by Tencent, it makes sense to use their popular formula and bring it to mobile phones.With League of Legends being handled by Garena in the Philippines, the framework for a successful market for Arena of Valor seems set in place. Jan Frederic Chiong, the Country Manager for Garena Philippines, shares this confidence and in a press release stated:

>“We are excited to launch Arena of Valor in the Philippines as Asia represents a multi-billion dollar gaming industry with 80% of its gamers playing mobile games. As a game publisher, Garena has spearheaded various top-tier titles across Southeast Asia to great effect. As we welcome the latest addition to our growing list, we aim for AOV to be positioned as the best mobile experience for gamers in the Philippines.”
