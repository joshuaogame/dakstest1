Two teams have been added to the Overwatch League! Team Seoul and Team Boston have both unveiled their branding and logos. The 5th and 6th branded teams have made a spectacle of their announcements, complete with rosters for each team.
Boston Uprising
The Boston Uprising, backed by the Kraft Group, shares the same sponsorship with the New England Patriots. According to the official release, the name Uprising comes from the revolutionary spirit the city of Boston entails in American History. Calling back to the great Boston Tea Party, the spirit of the revolution is strong within the city of Boston, and the team hopes to match this spirit with their play. The colors are blue, yellow, and black, and the color tones call back to the flag of the city. The logo is a shield in the shape of a B, which the city of Boston is synonymous with.

Robert Kraft, CEO and chairman of the Kraft group, was quoted to be “excited to unveil” the team’s branding. Expounding, he said:
> “We look forward to introducing sports fans in Boston to the new Overwatch League with a local team they can support. We are also eager to use the Boston Uprising to introduce Boston and our franchise to the global community of esports. We are currently assembling a team that we anticipate will compete for championships, as Boston sports fans have come to expect from all of their professional teams.”

Seoul Dynasty
Team Seoul has had their roster out for the longest time. Released as the first news on any team of the Overwatch League, Lunatic-Hai comprised the first 6 members of Team Seoul. The official press release has finally come! Branded as the Seoul Dynasty, the team is already looking forward to long-term success. Building on the results of Lunatic-Hai, the Seoul Dynasty seeks to build on these historical victories.

The symbol of the tiger was chosen as it is the national symbol of South Korea. With the tiger representing royalty, strength, courage, and good fortune, the colors of black and gold were chosen to convey power and a regal vibe. With the logo’s tenants, the Seoul Dynasty knows that its city’s role in esports history is unchallenged as an origin point. Kevin Chou, CEO of backing organization KSV, emphasizes this responsibility, stating:
> “Seoul is the birthplace of modern-day esports and holds a significant place in history, in addition to being the long-standing capital of the Joseon Dynasty and modern-day Korea. We have a tremendous responsibility to represent the best of Seoul on a global stage.”
With the reveal by KSV Esports, the venture of East meets West has come to fruition. With the reach of the Californian Silicon Valley in conjunction with the Korean esports culture, the Seoul Dynasty has only improved from its original incarnation. 3 players have been added to the original six from Lunatic-Hai. The now 9-man roster is as follows:
Tank
Jin-hyuk “Miro” Gong
DPS
In-jae “EscA” Kim
Sang-Beom “Munchkin” Byeon
Byung Sun “Fleta” Kim
Support
