The Philippines has a representative to a major Overwatch event in Southeast Asia! Miraculum has made it to the top 16 of the region and will go to Kuala Lumpur. With a roster fielding ace DPS players Gian “Alaya” Santos and Fil “Xenos” Mayor, the flexible Joshua “Grand” Ogame, the stalwart tank Yuuki “Fascinate” Tanaka, and the dependable supports Zyrille King “Zyrille” Algenio and Dexter “Daily420” Paglinawan, they breezed through their opponents in the Online Qualifiers.

Playing two Best of 3 matches, Miraculum first faced off against team Aimbot of Indonesia. They had an intense back-and-forth on Ilios but were able to secure the win on the first map. The second map of Kings Row was a whole different story, where their sturdy defense secured the point against Aimbot and they won their first series, 2–0.

Miraculum’s side of the Online Qualifiers. All four teams (Miraculum, StarEffect, Chaos Theory, and BBONG) on the right-most side move on to the LAN in Kuala Lumpur.

In the second match-up the next day, Miraculum fought team NotFatGaming of Thailand. They dominated the sets, crushing NotFatGaming on both Lijiang Tower and Watchpoint: Gibraltar. They had two 100%-0% to take the first map of Lijiang Tower and fended off NotFatGaming at the first point on Watchpoint: Gibraltar. When the payload on Watchpoint: Gibraltar reached the short distance NotFatGaming set, Miraculum celebrated their qualification to the LAN.

With the Online Qualifiers having finished this weekend, the LAN is set to occur on October 27 to October 29. Miraculum will be fighting for the 10,000 Malaysian Ringgit prize pool, which equates to around Php 120,000. Facing off teams in the SEA region, Miraculum will seek to prove their worth in the international scene and show to fellow Filipinos that the local scene is alive and worth the attention.
