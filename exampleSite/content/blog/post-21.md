With the roster for San Francisco previously revealed, their branding has now been unveiled. The San Francisco Shock are ready to go, with their logo and colors incorporating the defining characteristics of the Bay Area. A seismograph notes the earthquake activity of the area. Also, the logo follows the silhouette of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge. The gold color was chosen as it notes the history of the area, wherein the California Gold Rush brought settlers to the West Coast.

In the official press statement for the Shock, NRG Esports notes their excitement. Andy Miller, Founder and CEO of NRG Esports, notes that there “…is no better market to establish as the epicenter of esports than San Francisco.” Their reasoning for their branding was also brought up, with Miller stating:

>We took great care to choose a logo and identity that would both represent the attributes and traditions of San Francisco, yet at the same time speak to the future of sports and the Shock’s ambitions to take its place as a fixture next to the Bay Area’s championship sports teams.


Andy Miller was also featured in an in-depth interview about his thoughts and his confidence in the Overwatch League. When asked about the roster, he believes that there “…needs to be an all-around team because all-around teams usually win in every game.” He notes that he is still unsure though, as NRG Overwatch coach Brad Rajani thinks otherwise, with the coach stating that a superstar could carry the game for the most part. Also, Miller defends the 9-man roster reveal, with him noting the ineligibility of both Sinatraa and Super for the start of the season. The 9-man roster will be swapped in and out as they will work out who plays and fits the team best. Miller also brings up that esports is more personal than regular sports, with more interaction due to the players’ youth and lack of experience in the world.


The San Francisco Shock join the Dallas Fuel and the Shanghai Dragons as the first 3 teams to reveal their logo and name for the Overwatch League.
